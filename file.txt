The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
The truth will set you free.
The love of money is the root of all evil.
Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward.
Together we can change the world, just one random act of kindness at a time.
I don't believe that if you do good, good things will happen.
